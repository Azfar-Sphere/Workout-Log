# Workout-Log
My CS50x Final Project. This is an application meant to ease recording my workouts and exercises.

This is still a WIP,
I've made a basic workout-logger, before adding more features I am trying to get workbox to work to enable PWA functionality. Having spent a week on this, it seems that using workbox with flask seems like a task way above my paygrade.

Either way, I will finished developing my HTML webapp at least.

To run this app, run main.py
