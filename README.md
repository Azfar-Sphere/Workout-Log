### The Idea:
As someone who goes to the gym and tracks his workouts, I found it tedious to manually log my workout details using my phone's notepad. Realizing the need for efficiency, for mt CS50 project, I embarked on creating an app that streamlines and refines the process of entering the number of reps and sets. This application is tailored to enhance the efficiency of tracking my workout days, ensuring a seamless and time-saving experience compared to the traditional note-taking method on my phone.
